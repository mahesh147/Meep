# Meep
A simple 2D android side-scroller platform game made using GameMaker Studios. The objective of this game to move the character "Meep" across the levels by titlting the device. Tapping on the screen causes Meep to jump. Avoid the spikes. Reach the flag at the end of the level to proceed to the next level.

As usual, game files and .apk included in the repo. Open the .gmx in GameMaker Studios to edit this game.

The game is just a proof of concept and far from a finished product. It's rough around the edges *but is still very much playable*. I won't be updating or patching this game since I've moved to other projects.
